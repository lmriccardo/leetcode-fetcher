## Version [`v0.1.1`](https://github.com/lmriccardo/leetcode-fetcher/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

This new release does not add new functionalities to the application, indeed it is a **Bug-Fix** release.

#### Fixed Bugs:

- *Docker Build file* (i.e., Dockerfile). It now directly creates the `/leetcode` folder owned by the `node` user and sets it as the main working folder. So that, once the application starts, all files in the host folder that are mounted into the /leetcode folder are directly accessible by the application without the need to pre-append the `/leetcode` prefix anywhere. Moreover, in order to the make the application accessible whenever in the container file system, the Dockerfile now compile the Typescript into pure Javascript and the application is installed globally using the `npm install -g .` command.
