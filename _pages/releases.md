# Leetcode Fetcher Releases ðŸš€

Each release version of LeetCode Fetcher is in the format `vZ.Y.X`:

- `Z` represents the *master* version, i.e., every version that absolutely work and with a large set of features
- `Y` represents the *major* version, i.e., every version that adds a new group of features, bug fixes and new bugs
- `X` represents the *minor* version, i.e., every version that complete small tasks up to the next major update

In particular, a `vZ.Y.(X + i)` becomes a `vZ.(Y+j).0` when the entire lists of tasks planned for the next release group is completed and major features have been introduced into the application.

The latest available release is the [`v0.1.1`]({{site.baseurl}}/releases/v0/)
