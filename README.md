## About âœ¨

When solving leetcode problems, I would have like to have a tool or a utility able to automatically provides me with a number of problems and, for each of them, creates a local instance with the problem description and the provided snippet of code. Thus avoiding every time to manually copy everything locally, resolve the imports and setup the tests.

The final result of this need is **leetcode-fetcher**, a simple cli applications that interacts with leetcode through the *GraphQL* endpoint, in order to fetch problems and user statistics.

## Running the App ðŸš€

Up to now, to run the application you need first to clone the repository, install all the required node modules and then run. 

```
git clone https://github.com/lmriccardo/leetcode-fetcher.git
npm install && npm run app
```

Please, make sure to have node.js and npm installed in your system.

## How the application works ðŸ’»

When first the application starts, the following line will appear:

```
>> (Type help for commands): 
```

If you type `help` the list with all possible commands will appear. That is, the application works giving specific commands and then pressing ENTER to execute it. Every time, either an error or the output pops out, you will always see the initial line and new commands can be given. Here is the list with all possible commands:

| **Name**         | **Syntax**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _Help_   | `help [cmd1 cmd2 ...]`          | Shows the helper message for each given command. If no command is provided, consider all.                                                                                     |
| _Set_    | `set [VAR value ...]`           | Set the value of the specified variable. To inspect available variables use the `show` command.                                                                               |
| _Unset_  | `unset [VAR1 VAR2 ...]`         | Unset variables bringing back to their default values.                                                                                                                        |
| _Show_   | `show`                          | Shows values and informations about the application state and variables.                                                                                                      |
| _List_   | `list`                          | Locally fetches a number of problems from leetcode. The search is filtered using the _variables_ set with `set` or `unset`                                                    |
| _Detail_	 | `detail <id/idx> [BYID\|BYIDX]` | Print details about a specified problem. A problem is specified either by local indexing, or remote question IDs.                                                             |
| _Fetch_  | `fetch <NAME\|ID> <value>`      | Fetch locally a single problem from remote. The problem is specified either using the title-slug or the remote ID.                                                            |
| _Create_ | `create <idx>`                  | Create a problem instance in the provided target folder (which is a variable). The problem is specified only by the local index which means that must already exists locally. |

In order to obtain more informations about the commands, run the `help` command.

An output example is already present in the <a href="./examples/python/9-palindrome-number">./examples/python/9-palindrome-number</a> folder. It has been obtained running the following commands:

```
>> (Type help for commands): fetch ID 9
Total Problems: 3028
Fetched Problems: 1
[0] <ID=9> (Easy) PALINDROME NUMBER [Math]

>> (Type help for commands): set FOLDER ./examples/python
>> (Type help for commands): create 0
Result written in folder: examples\python\9-palindrome-number
```

## Current Limitations and futures ðŸš§

- Up to now, the only possible target language to save the problem code snippet is Python3. 
- Source code formatting bug when the problem introduces structures or mulitple function definition (try a tree problem)
- Planning to introduce user statistics and user authentication (**if possible**)
- Planning to introduce watchers that sumbit the code automatically (**if possible**)
